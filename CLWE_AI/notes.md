## Notes on CLWE, Quantization, and the Random Fourier Feature Models

### Homogeneous CLWE and Its Quantization

CLWE (continuous learning with errors) is the continuous equivalent of learning with errors. At a _high_ level we have two equivalent hardness assumptions (decision and search version):


$$
  C_i \Var, \innerproduct{a}{b}
$$


\begin{equation}
  a + b = c
\end{equation}
